# Bonus
## Modify the project to be able to the following instead of  writing the to do items line by line (hint: use the json module):
- each to-do item should be saved with the following attributes:
- - title
  - date & time
  - done (default is false)

- User can display his to do list items as follows:
  ```
  1- Go to Gym - 2023-08-05 08:00:00 - DONE
  2- Visit Grandma - 2023-08-08 21:00:00 - NOT DONE
  ```
  - User can mark a specific Task as Done.
  - User can search in his tasks using the title.
